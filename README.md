# Online-Payments-Fraud-Detection-using-Python

This project aims to identify fraudulent transactions in online payments using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains historical data on transactions, including features such as transaction type, amount, origin and destination accounts, and balances before and after transactions. The primary objective is to train a machine learning model to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent, leveraging features that indicate suspicious activities. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation to enhance the detection of fraudulent transactions effectively.
Introduction and Objective: The project begins with an overview of the goal, which is to detect online payment fraud using machine learning techniques. It describes the dataset and its features, such as transaction type, amount, origin and destination accounts, and balance details before and after transactions.

Data Import and Initial Exploration:

The dataset is loaded using pandas.
An initial check on the dataset is done, including displaying the first few rows and checking for null values.
Data Exploration:

The notebook explores various features of the dataset, such as the type of transactions, to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
Data Preprocessing:

This likely includes cleaning the data, handling missing values (though none are found in this dataset), and preparing it for machine learning model training.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.
Model Training:

Various machine learning algorithms may be applied to train models that can classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
Model Evaluation:

The notebook likely concludes with evaluating the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most effective model for fraud detection.
